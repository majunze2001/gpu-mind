GPU page fault routine calls `uvm_va_block_select_residency` directly 

```bash

```


GPU page fault routine:
1. A thread in driver (CPU side) runs `_main_loop` [`nv-kthread-q.c`]
2. `nv_kthread_q_init_on_node` creates the `_main_loop` thread
3. `uvm_gpu_init_isr`[`uvm_gpu_isr.c:280`] calls `init_queue_on_node` to init the bottom half queue for _main_loop to fetch and handle. `uvm_gpu_init_isr` should init a fault handling state read from GPU throuhg `uvm_gpu_fault_buffer_init`
    1. `uvm_gpu_fault_buffer_init`[`uvm_gpu_replayable_faults.c:229`] calls `fault_buffer_init_replayable_faults`:122 for replayable faults, 
    2. `fault_buffer_init_replayable_faults` fetches (also sets some fields of) parent_gpu's fault_buffer_info.replayable [most info is probably filled up before hand or by hardware], and allocate '0' memory for field in fault_buffer_info.replayable->batch_service_context --- batch_service_context.
    it then calls `fault_buffer_reinit_replayable_faults`
    which seems to read from gpu buffer `replayable_faults->cached_get = parent_gpu->fault_buffer_hal->read_get(parent_gpu);`

@Seung-seob Lee Hey Seoung-seob, I can set the value of `nextCopyAddress` through an `ioctl` call in user-space for now, but I think we will probably need one more variable `copyFromAddress`.  

There is only one valid page across the system, whether it is in CPU or GPU memory. At first this page is at address A on CPU, and it will be migrated to GPU through a memory access (page fault) on GPU (via the original logic). After this is done, user-space program issues an `ioctl` call to set `copyFromAddress` to A. Then issue a second `ioctl` call to set `nextCopyAddress` to B and start the routine to copy the page on GPU to address B on CPU.

However, we are some what "reimplementing" what is already implemented. CUDA comes with explicit memcopy commands to copy data between CPU and GPU.


Some channel types and abbreviations
Work Launch Channel (WLC)
Launch Confirmation Indicator Channel (LCIC)


How does CPU knows if a push is completed:
// Channel tracking semaphore value that indicates completion of
// this entry.
NvU64 tracking_semaphore_value;
